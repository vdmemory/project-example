                <p>
                    When you register for an Account, Breef will contact you
                    with both Service-related and marketing emails and
                    communications. We will use your Account-registered personal
                    information to send this content to you. If you do not want
                    to receive such email messages and communications, you will
                    be given the option to opt out or change your account
                    preferences. You can also contact us at{' '}
                    <a className="accent" href="mailto:support@breef.com">
                        {' '}
                        support@breef.com
                    </a>
                    . You will not be able to opt out of Service-related emails
                    and communications. By continuing to maintain an Account
                    and/or use the Service, you acknowledge and agree that Breef
                    shall be permitted to continue Service-related emails and
                    communications.

                <h3>Advertisements</h3>

                <p>
                    Breef may also share certain information such as your
                    browser and cookie data and other data relating to your use
                    of our Service with our business partners to deliver
                    advertisements (“ads”) that may be of interest to you. Breef
                    may allow third party ad servers or ad networks to serve
                    advertisements on the Service. These third party ad servers
                    or ad networks use technology to send, directly to your
                    browser, the ads and ad links that appear on the Service,
                    and will automatically receive your IP address when they do
                    so. They may also use other technologies (such as cookies,
                    JavaScript and clear gifs, see above) to compile information
                    about your browser’s visits and usage patterns on the
                    Service, and to measure the effectiveness of their ads and
                    to personalize the advertising content. Breef does not sell,
                    rent, or share the information we collect directly from you
                    or about you from third parties with these third party ad
                    servers or ad networks for such parties’ own marketing
                    purposes.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Please note that an advertiser may ask Breef to show an ad
                    to a certain audience of Users (e.g., based on demographics
                    or other interests). In that situation, Breef determines the
                    target audience and Breef serves the advertising to that
                    audience and only provides anonymous aggregated data to the
                    advertiser. If you respond to such an ad, the advertiser or
                    ad server may conclude that you fit the description of the
                    audience they are trying to reach.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The Breef Privacy Policy does not apply to, and we cannot
                    control the activities of, third party advertisers. Please
                    consult the respective privacy policies of such advertisers
                    or contact such advertisers for more information
                </p>

                <h3>Cookies, Log Data, Gifs/web beacons</h3>

                <h4>Cookies Information</h4>
                <p>
                    When you use the Service, we may send one or more cookies —
                    a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric
                    characters — to your computer that uniquely identifies your
                    browser and lets Breef help you log in faster and enhance
                    your navigation through our websites. A cookie may also
                    convey information to us about how you use the Service
                    (e.g., the pages you view, the links you click and other
                    actions you take on the Service), and allow us or our
                    business partners to track your usage of the Service over
                    time. A persistent cookie remains on your hard drive after
                    you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by
                    your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent
                    cookies can be removed by following your web browser’s
                    directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears
                    after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser
                    to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being
                    sent. However, some features of the Service may not function
                    properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
                </p>

                <h4>Log file Information</h4>
                <p>
                    Log file information is automatically reported by your
                    browser each time you access the Service. When you use our
                    Service, our servers automatically record certain log file
                    information. These server logs may include anonymous
                    information such as your web request, Internet Protocol
                    (“IP”) address, browser type, referring / exit pages and
                    URLs, number of clicks and how you interact with links on
                    the Service, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed, and
                    other such information. We may combine log file information
                    with third party services (for example, Google Analytics)
                    which we use to improve site functionality, improve security
                    and provide Service improvements.
                </p>

                <h4>Clear gifs/web beacons information</h4>
                <p>
                    When you use the Service, we may employ clear gifs (also
                    known as web beacons) that are used to anonymously track the
                    online usage patterns of our Users. In addition, we may also
                    use clear gifs in HTML-based emails sent to our Users to
                    track which emails are opened and which links are clicked by
                    recipients. The information allows for more accurate
                    reporting and improvement of the Service.
                </p>
                <h3>Links to third party websites</h3>

                    The Breef Service is linked to external websites and service
                    providers. Our Terms of Use, Privacy Policy and other
                    Policies only apply to Breef websites. A link to a third
                    party website is not an endorsement of that third party or
                    its website. Please note that when you use a link to go from
                    the Service to another website, our Privacy Policy, Terms of
                    Use and other Policies do not apply to third party websites
                    and services.{' '}
                </p>
                <p>
                    We do not review any linked websites for content, terms of
                    use or for any other reason. You agree that we are not
                    responsible and we do not have control over any third party
                    websites. If you are using a third party website or service,
                    you do so at your own risk. Breef is also not responsible
                    for websites directing you to Breef. Our Terms of Use and
                    Privacy Policy do not apply to those websites either. This

                    by other means (including offline) or from other sources
                    other than through the Service. We recommend that you review
                    the relevant terms and privacy policies of websites that you
                    visit.

                <h3>Managing your Account information</h3>
                <p>
                    It is your responsibility to update your personal
                    information and ensure that it is accurate, complete and up
                    to date. You can update the profile information in your

                <h3>Security</h3>
                <p>
                    The security of your personal information is our highest
                    priority. While no method of transmission and storage over
                    the Internet is 100% secure, we use a variety of security
                    measures to protect your information. This includes,
                    encrypting of sensitive information using secure socket
                    layer technology (SSL), use of secure server communications
                    in the form of HTTPS, protection of your identity when you
                    choose not to share it with a User, and the use of internal
                    and external security and vulnerability testing techniques.
                    In the event that any information under Breef's control is
                    compromised as a result of breach of security, Breef will
                    take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where
                    appropriate, notify those Users whose information may have
                    been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with
                    any applicable laws and regulations. The sharing of any
                    Project and Pitch information is a matter between Users
                    (i.e. Clients and Agency Talent), as is any relevant work
                    product and personal information shared between those
                    parties. The sharing of such information will be the
                    responsibility of the parties to manage through any work
                    agreements, including (but not limited to), non-disclosure
                    agreements.
                </p>

                <h3>Passwords and Account Protection</h3>
                <p>
                    To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable
                    steps (such as requesting a unique password) to verify your
                    identity before granting you access to your Account. You are
                    responsible for maintaining the secrecy of your unique
                    password and Account information, and for controlling access
                    to your email communications from Breef, at all times.
                </p>

                <h3>Information Storage and Transfer</h3>
                <p>
                    Breef is based in the United States. If you are registering
                    with the Service from a jurisdiction outside the United
                    States, your information will be transferred to Breef in the
                    United States. Your information may also be transferred
                    outside of the United States and stored on information
                    systems where privacy laws differ from your jurisdiction.
                    Your use of the Service means that you acknowledge and agree
                    that your information will be governed by the laws of the
                    United States, and you agree that your information may be
                    transferred outside of the United States.
                </p>

                <h3>Change in Control</h3>
                <p>
                    We may buy or sell/divest/transfer Breef (including any
                    shares in Breef), or any combination of its products,
                    services, assets and/or businesses. Your information such as
                    customer names and email addresses, User content and other
                    user information related to the Service may be among the
                    items sold or otherwise transferred in these types of
                    transactions. We may also sell, assign or otherwise transfer
                    such information in the course of corporate divestitures,
                    mergers, acquisitions, bankruptcies, dissolutions,
                    reorganizations, liquidations, similar transactions or
                    proceedings involving all or a portion of Breef and/or the
                    Service.

                <h3>How long we keep User Information</h3>
                <p>
                    In the event of termination or deactivation of your Account,
                    Breef may retain your profile information and User content
                    for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival or
                    audit purposes. In certain circumstances, we will be
                    required by Federal and State regulations to store various
                    information. In order to comply with those requirements, we
                    may be unable to delete your information from our database
                    until the expiration of the applicable period.{' '}
                </p>

                <h3>Compliance with Laws</h3>
                <p>
                    Breef may be required under certain circumstances to
                    disclose your information in order to comply with certain
                    laws. We will do so in our sole discretion, including but
                    not limited to, responding to legal process, for public
                    safety, to prevent illegal activity, to protect our own
                    intellectual property and/or the Service, to protect third
                    party interests. Use of your information for what we
                    consider 'legal' or 'protection' purposes shall be at our
                    sole discretion.
